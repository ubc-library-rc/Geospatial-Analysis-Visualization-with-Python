# Police-Involved Deaths: in Canada

### June Skeeter [They/Them/Theirs]: skeeter1@mail.ubc.ca

# Content Warning
I will be speaking about police violence today.  This difficult and painful subject may be triggering to some, especially BIPOC individuals.

# Land Acknowledgement
I am speaking to you today from the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), səl̓ilwətaɁɬ təməxʷ (Tsleil-Waututh), Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Temíx̱w (Squamish) Nations.
* I encourage each of you to take a moment to explore [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/).  This is by no means a definitive source, but it's a good place to start building an understanding of the Indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.

# Why Police-Involved Deaths in Canada?

Candian instututions rely on the lack of race based statistics to perpetuate a narrative that systemic racism is "just an American issue" and that Canada is "better".  As a white settler and immigrant from the United States, I fell for that narrative and did not question it for years.  
* We need to have discussions about systemic racism in Canada and make it part of the public discourse in order to hold Canadian institutions accountable.
