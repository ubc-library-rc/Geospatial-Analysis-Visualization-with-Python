Once on the scene, they arrested D'amour. The 77-year-old resisted, refusing to leave his home, according to Quebec's BEI. Police deployed pepper spray, handcuffed him and then saw that he was having trouble breathing. An ambulance was called. D'amour died in hospital. The autopsy report states cause of death was a burst artery, not the application of force by police. The BEI found that there was reason to suspect wrongdoing and provided their notes to the Crown for consideration. "

Officers say the man was acting erratically, and after a physical struggle two officers used their Tasers. More officers arrived and they detained the man. While on the floor, he flailed his legs, screamed and spit blood, according to officers. When paramedics arrived, they injected the man twice with a sedative. An SIU report says the man calmed down but lapsed into cardiac arrest. An officer conducted CPR and the man regained a heartbeat but never regained consciousness. He was pronounced dead at hospital. A post-mortem determined his cause of death to be cocaine and methamphetamine toxicity. The SIU absolved officers of any wrongdoing."
