    "content": "# Territorial and Cultural Acknowledgement The University of British Columbia and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples. Specifically the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), əl̓ilwətaɁɬ (Tsleil-Waututh), and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh (Squamish) Nations. There are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent. Map Source --- # Why Do an Acknowledgement? For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous cultures and identity from both the land and the map. Historically, maps have been used as tools of oppression and we must work to de-colonize our practices in GIS. A land acknowledgement is one small way to help with that. It isn't just a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding. To learn more about the Indigenous people, culture, and languages where you live and around the world, check out [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/). ## What Does it Mean? What do we mean when we say **traditional**, **ancestral**, and **unceded territory**? It is meant to convey a deep rooted cultural connection to the land and coven the historical and present day injustices and violence enacted on Indigenous communities through colonialism. ### **Traditional** Recognizes that the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied. The [xʷməθkʷəy̓əm](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/x%ca%b7m%c9%99%ce%b8k%ca%b7%c9%99y%cc%93%c9%99m/), [əl̓ilwətaɁɬ](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/tsleil-waututh-s%c9%99l%cc%93ilw%c9%99ta%c9%82%c9%ac/), and [Skwxwú7mesh-ulh](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/skwxwu7mesh-uxwumixw/) Nations have traditionally occupied this area. ### **Ancestral** Recognizes territories and cultures have been handed down from generation to generation. One example is language, which has strong connections to ancestry. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of [Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/hulquminum-halqemeylem-h%c9%99n%cc%93q%cc%93%c9%99min%cc%93%c9%99m%cc%93/) and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak [Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/s%e1%b8%b5wx%cc%b1wu7mesh-snichim/). ### **Unceded** Refers to land that was not turned over to the government by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty. Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home. Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were \"ceded\" by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The [RCMP](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/203-the-secret-life-of-canada/episode/15798131-s3-the-mounties-always-get-their-land-part-1) was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary.

If you want to install Python on your own computer, check out [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). * Anaconda will install many of the most commonly used python packages and set everything up for you. * Anaconda won't install *every* package we're using today, but installing new packages is fairly straightforward. **Other resources**: If you're having issues with Python, a great place to check out is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). It is a popular forum where you can search, post, and answer coding questions. A related site that is more GIS focused site is [Stack Exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) ## Download the Code and Data **Video Reference**: This video covers the steps in case you get lost. *Note* this video is for a different workshop, but other than the github url and folder names, everything else is the same. **1**{: .label .label-red } **Start a Jupyter Lab** UBC provides server space where you can run Python using [Jupyter Lab](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter). Login with your CWL. You'll then be taken to a blank Jupyter lab. This is a good option for getting your bearings because nearly everything is already set up. You don't have to worry about installing anything on your own system. * This may be intimidating, but don't worry, you don't need to know command line to do this. I'll walk you through step by step. **2**{: .label .label-red } **Open a terminal** We're going to open a terminal and use command line clone (\"download\") the Github workshop's repository. In they Jupyter window, click **File>>New** in the top right and select **Terminal** from the drop-down menu. **3**{: .label .label-red } **Clone the Repository** **clone** tells **git** (a file tracking software) to download a repository (collection of code, data, etc.) for this workshop. A folder called **Geocoding-Web-Mapping-with-Python** will appear after you clone the repository. You can explore it using the file viewer on the left, or you can use the command line. In the new terminal window that opens, paste this command and hit enter: ```console https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/Geospatial-Analysis-Visualization-with-Python/ ``` **4**{: .label .label-red } **Installing a Package** **pip** (package installer for Python) is a tool we can use to install packages. All tha packages we need today are already installe, but if you needed to install one, this is how you would do it. In the terminal window type the command below and hit enter to install the Geopy package: ```console pip install geopy ``` **5**{: .label .label-red } **Opening a Jupyter Notebook** In the file viewer you will see a folder called **Geospatial-Analysis-Visualization-with-Python**, double clicking the folder will open it. You'll see a collection of folders and files. The one we will be working in today is called **Python_Notebooks**. In this folder you will see three files with **.ipynb** tag, that denotes a **Jupyter Notebook**. A Notebook is a collection of code and annotations that can be run interactively. Double click a notebook to open. * **Getting Started with Python.ipynb**: will give you an introduction to data analysis with Python. * **Working with Geopandas.ipynb**: will give you an introduction to using geopands to: * Importing, edit, viewing, and writing vector data * Change coordinate reference systems * Spatial overlay * Clip * **Example Workflow.ipynb**: Shows a practical application of how you can use python violence at the hands of Police in BC. This will also introduce new skills: * Import a .csv file and project latitude/longitude data * Spatial overlay * Spatial join * Point in polygon * Calculate kernel density * Save raster layer ",

    "content": "# Why Python? Its a great language! But its not the only language. Just as English, Cantonese, or Punjabi could all be used to explain systemic racism; Python, Javascirpt, or R can all be used to quantify and visualize the scale of the problem. like python because its very flexible, fairly easy to read / write, well suited for data analysis, has lots of packages for GIS, and it's completely free! ## Packages Python has a number of built in functionality, but many of the most useful tools and functions come require us to [import](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) packages. * Packages are pre-written blocks of code, sometimes referred to as libraries. * They are built for addressing specific tasks: e.g. linear algebra, mapping, plotting. # Geospatial Analysis There are two main data models we use to represent spatial information in GIS. The **Vector** data model represents spatial features as points, lines, and/or polygons, and stores attributes about them in an associated attribute table. The **Raster** data model represents spatial features as a continuous grid of cells, with each cell storing one attribute. For working with vector data, [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) is one of your best options. It is a spatial extension for pandas, a popular package for handling tabular datasets. For working with raster data, [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a good option. The key reason we need special packages for working with spatial data is because we need to be able to manage different spatial reference systems. ",

TOC {:toc} # Content Warning This workshop deals with a difficult and painful subject that may be triggering to some, especially BIPOC individuals. We are going to use a dataset of police killings and police involved deaths in Canada. The intent behind choosing this dataset end goal of this workshop is to show that GIS, programming, data analysis, and data visualization can be powerful tools for promoting social and environmental justice issues. # Learning Objectives 1) Cursory overview of data analysis with Python. 2) Introduction to geospatial analysis with Python. * Reading and writing vector data. * Vector overlays. * Spatial intepolation. 3) Creating geospatial visualizations with Python # Why Police-Involved Deaths in Canada? Racism is ingrained in the history of policing in Canada since the founding of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1873. Police play a central tool in Canada's ongoing genocide of Indigenous people and they work to maintain systems of oppression throughout in Canadian society. Canadian institutions rely on the lack of race based statistics and other demographic information to perpetuate a narrative that systemic racism is \"just an American issue\" and that Canada is \"better\". As a white settler and immigrant from the United States, I fell for that narrative and did not question it for years. * We need to have discussions about systemic racism in Canada and make it part of the public discourse in order to hold Canadian institutions accountable. ## Notes on Terminology **Police Killing:** A death directly resulting from police use of force. Including but not limited to: shooting, tazing, other use of force. **Police-Involved Deaths** Any civilian death at the hands of police or in the custody of police. Includes police killings deaths resulting from police negligence/inaction: suicide, overdoses, medical emergencies, etc. This is broader term that is more difficult to refute on the grounds of semantics. ## Increasing Police Violence in Canada There has been an increasing trend in deaths at the hands of Canadian Police over recent years [1](https://police-involved-deaths-ca.github.io/Data/#increasing-police-violence-in-canada) . This may be partly an result of greater access to information, but it is also likely that Canadian Police *are* becoming more violent. ",
