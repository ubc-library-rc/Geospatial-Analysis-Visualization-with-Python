But its not the only language. Just as English, Cantonese, or Punjabi could all be used to explain systemic racism; Python, Javascirpt, or R can all be used to quantify and visualize the scale of the problem. like python because its very flexible, fairly easy to read / write, well suited for data analysis, has lots of packages for GIS, and it's completely free! ## Packages Python has a number of built in functionality, but many of the most useful tools and functions come require us to [import](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) packages. * Packages are pre-written blocks of code, sometimes referred to as libraries. * They are built for addressing specific tasks: e.g. linear algebra, mapping, plotting. ## Accessing Python Today We'll be using a UBC server with python already installed on it. If you want to install Python on your own computer, check out [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). * Anaconda will install most commonly used python packages and set everything up for you. * Anaconda won't install *every* package we're using today, but installing new packages is fairly straightforward. ## Other resources If you're having issues with Python, a great place to check out is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). It is a popular forum where you can search, post, and answer coding questions. * A related site that is more GIS focused site is [Stack Exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) # Download the Code and Data **1**{: .label .label-red } **Start a Jupyter Lab** UBC provides server space where you can run Python using [Jupyter Lab](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter). Login with your CWL. You'll then be taken to a blank jupyter lab. * This is good option for getting your bearings because nearly everything is already set up. You don't have to worry about installing anything on your own system. * This may sound intimidating/confusing. But don't worry, its easy. You don't need to know command line to do this. I'll walk you through step by step. You can also refer to the video below for help **2**{: .label .label-red } **Open a terminal** We're going to open a command terminal and use command line clone the Github workshop's repository. * In they Jupyter window, click File>\"New\" in the top right and select \"Terminal\" from the drop-down menu. **3**{: .label .label-red } **Clone the Repository** Cloning tells Git (a file tracking software) to download a repository (collection of code, data, etc.) for this workshop. In the new terminal window that opens, paste this command and hit enter: https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/Geospatial-Analysis-Visualization-with-Python A folder called Geocoding-Web-Mapping-with-Python should now be visible. You can explore it using file viewer on the left, or you can use the command line (see video). **4**{: .label .label-red } **Installing a Package** In the terminal window type the command below and hit enter to install the geopy package. We aren't actually working with this package today, but this package was used to geocode the addressees in the [dataset in this workshop](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/Geocoding-Web-Mapping-with-Python/). pip install geopy **5**{: .label .label-red } **Opening a Jupyter Notebook** In the file viewer You will notice a folder with the same name as the repository you just cloned, double clicking the folder will open it. You'll see a folders and a collection of files. The one we'll be working in is called \"Python_Notebooks\". Double click to enter. * The .ipynb tag on the end denotes a Jupyter \"Notebook\" * A Notebook is a collection of Python code and annotations that can be run interactively. * Double click on \"Getting Started with Python.ipynb\" to open it. # Video Reference This video covers the above steps - **Note** the video instructions reference a different workshop, but the procedures are exactly the same.

    "content": "# Geospatial Analysis and Visualization with Python {: .no_toc } Workshop created by June Skeeter june.skeeter@mubc.ca for the UBC Library Search Commons. {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} # Content Warning This workshop deals with a difficult and painful subject that may be triggering to some, especially BIPOC individuals. We are going to use a dataset of police killings and police involved deaths in Canada. The intent behind choosing this dataset end goal of this workshop is to show that GIS, programming, data analysis, and data visualization can be powerful tools for promoting social and environmental justice issues. # Why Police-Involved Deaths in Canada? Racism is ingrained in the history of policing in Canada since the founding of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1873. Police in Canada play a central tool in Canada's ongoing genocide of Indigenous people, actively work to oppress BIPOC communities, and maintain systems of oppression in Canadian society. Police institutions exist to do the bidding of those in power, not protect the public. Canadian institutions rely on the lack of race based statistics and other demographic information to perpetuate a narrative that systemic racism is \"just an American issue\" and that Canada is \"better\". As a white settler and immigrant from the United States, I fell for that narrative and did not question it for years. * We need to have discussions about systemic racism in Canada and make it part of the public discourse in order to hold Canadian institutions accountable. ## Notes on Terminology **Police Killing:** A death directly resulting from police use of force. Including but not limited to: shooting, tazing, other use of force. **Police-Involved Deaths** Any civilian death at the hands of police or in the custody of police. Includes police killings deaths resulting from police negligence/inaction: suicide, overdoses, medical emergencies, etc. This is broader term that is more difficult to refute on the grounds of semantics. ## Increasing Police Violence in Canada There has been an [increasing trend](https://police-involved-deaths-ca.github.io/Data/#increasing-police-violence-in-canada) in deaths at the hands of Canadian Police over recent years. This may be partly an result of greater access to information, but it is also probable that Canadian Police *are* becoming more violent. # Territorial Acknowledgement UBC and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples. Specifically the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), əl̓ilwətaɁɬ (Tsleil-Waututh), and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh (Squamish) Nations. Map Source ## Why Do a Territorial Acknowledgement? For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous cultures and identity from both the land and the map. Historically, maps have been used as tools of oppression and we must work to de-colonize our practices in GIS. A land acknowledgement is one small way to help with that. It isn't just a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding. The maps and information presented below are sourced from [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/). ## What Does it Mean? Why do we say *traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory*? **Traditional**: recognizes that the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied. The [xʷməθkʷəy̓əm](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/x%ca%b7m%c9%99%ce%b8k%ca%b7%c9%99y%cc%93%c9%99m/), and [əl̓ilwətaɁɬ](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/tsleil-waututh-s%c9%99l%cc%93ilw%c9%99ta%c9%82%c9%ac/), [Skwxwú7mesh-ulh](https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/skwxwu7mesh-uxwumixw/)Nations have traditionally occupied this area. **Ancestral**: recognizes land that is handed down from generation to generation. It is meant to convey a deep rooted connection to the land. Language has strong connections to ancestry. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of [Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/hulquminum-halqemeylem-h%c9%99n%cc%93q%cc%93%c9%99min%cc%93%c9%99m%cc%93/) and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak [Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim](https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/s%e1%b8%b5wx%cc%b1wu7mesh-snichim/). **Unceded**: refers to land that was not turned over to the Crown (government) by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC was never ceded by treaty. # Learning Objectives 1) Cursory overview to python 2) Introduction to geospatial analysis data with python 3) Creating geospatial visualizations with python # Final Product The end goal of the workshop is to produce an infographic on Police violence in Canada like this one.
