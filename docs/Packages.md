# Geospatial Data in Python

For working with vector data, [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) is one of your best optioins.  It is a spatial extension for pandas, the package for handling tabluar data we just worked with.

* [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/)
	* Scipy is math library, we'll use it for calculating a linear regression & chi square
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html)
	* Matplotlib is a powerful plotting library.  We'll uses it to make detailed maps and graphs


### We'll be using a UBC server with python already installed.  It has every package we need already installed on it.
* If you are doing this using your own installation, you'll need to make sure you install each of the above packages.  Instructions can be found on each packages webpage
