# Python is a powerful programming language that is free to download and use.
* If you want your own installation, check out [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
  * It will install most commonly used python packages and set everything up for you.


### GIS w/ Python: Resources:

* A great place to go if you're having issues with python is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
	* Its a popular forum where you can search, post, and answer coding questions.
* A related site that is more GIS focused site is [Stack Exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/)


# Python relies on a series of packages (aka libraries) to handle different tasks

* Packages are collections of code that are designed specifically for performing different tasks, e.g.: Plotting, Statistics, Linear Algebra, etc.


## We'll be working with the following packages today
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
	* Numpy is a powerful math library for multidimensional data
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
	* Pandas is a powerful library for handling data
* [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/)
	* This is a geospatial extension to pandas.  We'll use it to handle and manipulate our geospatial data
* [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/)
	* Scipy is math library, we'll use it for calculating a linear regression & chi square
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html)
	* Matplotlib is a powerful plotting library.  We'll uses it to make detailed maps and graphs


### We'll be using a UBC server with python already installed.  It has every package we need already installed on it.
* If you are doing this using your own installation, you'll need to make sure you install each of the above packages.  Instructions can be found on each packages webpage
